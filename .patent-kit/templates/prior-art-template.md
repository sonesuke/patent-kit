## 4. Published Application Amendment Potential (If Applicable)

**Note**: Skip this section if all references are granted patents.

For published patent applications (not yet granted), assess the possibility of claim amendments based on embodiments:

| Doc Number | Application Status | Embodiment Scope                           | Amendment Potential | Assessment                                        |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| D1         | Published/Pending  | (Describe broader features in embodiments) | High/Medium/Low     | (Could claims be amended to cover broader scope?) |

**Reasoning**:

- Constitution VI states: "Consider the Detailed Description and embodiments as potential scope for future amendments."
- Evaluate whether embodiments disclose features that could be added to claims during examination.
- High potential: Embodiments clearly describe broader features that would strengthen comparison details.
- Low potential: Embodiments are consistent with current claims or narrower.

## 5. Similarity Assessment (Prior Art)

### Overall Similarity: [Significant Similarity / Moderate Similarity / Limited Similarity]

- **Significant Similarity**: References likely demonstrate significant similarity (Strong Relevance).
- **Moderate Similarity**: References show partial/arguable similarity.
- **Limited Similarity**: No strong references found (Patent Potentially Valid).

## 6. Conclusion

- **Verdict**: [Relevant prior art identified / Alternative implementation selected / Aligned with existing techniques / Escalated for legal review]
- **Reasoning**: ...

---

## 7. Quality Gates

- [ ] All top results reviewed.
- [ ] All non-patent literature top results reviewed.
- [ ] Grade A NPL candidates analyzed in detail.
- [ ] Claim chart completed for the closest prior art.
- [ ] Overall Similarity is formatted exactly as `Overall Similarity: Significant Similarity` (or Moderate/Limited).
- [ ] Final report documents BOTH patent and non-patent literature findings (Constitution III).
- [ ] Conclusion is supported by the comparison.
- [ ] **Verdict**: Must be strictly one of [Relevant prior art identified / Alternative implementation selected / Aligned with existing techniques / Escalated for legal review].
- [ ] **NO Legal Assertions**:
  - [ ] Avoid definitive legal terms (e.g., "invalid", "valid") in favor of technical comparisons.
  - [ ] Avoid terms: "Does not satisfy", "Does not infringe".
  - [ ] **Terminology**: Avoid "Is a core technology". Instead, use:
    - "Characteristic configuration"
    - "Major technical configuration"
    - "Characteristic implementation described in the patent"
  - [ ] Avoid citing specific court case examples.
  - [ ] Use descriptive technical language.
