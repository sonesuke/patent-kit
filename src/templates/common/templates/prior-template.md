## 5. Published Application Amendment Risk (If Applicable)

**Note**: Skip this section if all references are granted patents.

For published patent applications (not yet granted), assess the risk of claim amendments based on embodiments:

| Doc Number | Application Status | Embodiment Scope | Amendment Risk | Assessment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D1 | Published/Pending | (Describe broader features in embodiments) | High/Medium/Low | (Could claims be amended to cover broader scope?) |

**Reasoning**:

- Constitution VI states: "Consider the Detailed Description and embodiments as potential scope for future amendments."
- Evaluate whether embodiments disclose features that could be added to claims during examination.
- High risk: Embodiments clearly describe broader features that would strengthen infringement case.
- Low risk: Embodiments are consistent with current claims or narrower.
