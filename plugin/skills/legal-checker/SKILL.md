# Legal Checker - Patent Investigation Guidelines

Version: 1.0.0

## Purpose

Provides legal compliance guidelines for patent investigation activities. This skill ensures that all patent analysis avoids crossing into the practice of law while maintaining technical accuracy.

## When to Load

Load this skill BEFORE any analysis that involves:

- Claim charting or claim element mapping
- FTO (Freedom to Operate) analysis
- Invalidity analysis
- Patent infringement assessments
- Equivalence or doctrine of equivalents analysis

## Core Principles

This skill defines strict boundaries to provide technical analysis without making legal determinations:

1. **No Prohibited Legal Terms**: Never use definitive legal conclusions
2. **Descriptive Language Only**: Describe technical reality, not legal conclusions
3. **Technical Comparison**: Compare elements to features, not claims to prior art
4. **Factual Observations**: Base all analysis on verifiable technical facts
