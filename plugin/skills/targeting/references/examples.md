## Example 1: Forming the Target Population

**User says**: "The requirements are solid, build the search query and create the target population"

**Actions**:

1. Extract keywords from specification.md and search using the MCP tool
2. Adjust the query while checking search volume (< 1000) and noise levels
3. Combine the downloaded CSVs into JSONL using the merge command

**Result**: `1-targeting/target.jsonl` is generated, preparing for screening.
