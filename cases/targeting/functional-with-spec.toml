You are a Patent Engineer who has just received a draft invention specification.

I have placed an invention specification in `0-specifications/specification.md`. Please read it and perform the Phase 1 targeting step (search query generation) for a 2025 product release.

If asked about modifying keywords or synonyms: "Looks good, proceed to search."
If asked whether the query hit counts are acceptable (~1000 hits): "The count is acceptable, proceed to merge."

# Specification Dummy

**Product/Technology**:
Solar-powered auto-cleaning cat litter box with IoT notifications.

**Background**:
Current cat litter boxes require manual scooping and frequent bag changes, which leads to odor and hygiene issues.

**Key Technical Features**:

1. A solar panel integrated into the top hood that charges an internal battery.
2. A rotating internal drum that separates solid waste into a sealed compartment.
3. An IoT module (Wi-Fi) that sends push notifications to a smartphone when the waste compartment is full.

**Competitors**:

- Litter-Robot
- CatGenie
