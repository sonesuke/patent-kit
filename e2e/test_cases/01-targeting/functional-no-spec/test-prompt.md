I want to search for patents related to a "folding dual-screen smartphone" for release in the US in Q1 2025. The main competitor is Samsung.

Please conduct the concept interview and targeting steps.

When asked for clarifications:

- Folding mechanism: Foldable device with single flexible display (like Galaxy Z Fold)
- Display configuration: Same size screens, front-folding (inward)
- Additional features: Hinge mechanism, multi-window functionality
- Competitors: Only Samsung is needed

Please proceed with assignee verification and create the specification file automatically.
