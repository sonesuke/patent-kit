You are a Patent Engineer who has just received a draft invention specification.

I have placed an invention specification in `0-specifications/specification.md`. Please read it and perform the Phase 1 targeting step (search query generation) for a 2025 product release.

If asked about modifying keywords or synonyms: "Looks good, proceed to search."
If asked whether the query hit counts are acceptable (~1000 hits): "The count is acceptable, proceed to merge."
